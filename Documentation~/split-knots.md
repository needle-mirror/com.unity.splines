# Split knots

Split knots to separate a spline into two splines. 

You can only split a knot that has two segments. Split knots each have one segment. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you split a knot on a closed spline, the knot where the closure is becomes two [linked knots](link-unlink-knots.md) in two separate splines. These linked knots keep the shape of the original spline. 


To split a knot:
1. In the [Hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) or [Scene view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html), select a spline.
1. In the [Tools overlay](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/overlays.html), set the tool context to **Spline**.
1. Select a knot with two segments. 
1. In the Element Inspector overlay, select **Split**.
