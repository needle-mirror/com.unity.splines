# Split knots

Split knots to separate a spline into two splines.

You can only split a knot that has two segments. Split knots each have one segment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you split a knot on a closed spline, the knot where the closure is becomes two [linked knots](link-unlink-knots.md) in two separate splines. These linked knots keep the shape of the original spline.


To split a knot:
1. [!include[select-spline](.\\snippets\\select-spline.md)]
1. [!include[set-spline-context](.\\snippets\\set-spline-context.md)]
1. Select a knot with two segments.
1. In the Scene view, right-click to open the context menu.
1. In the Scene view context menu, select **Split Knot**.
