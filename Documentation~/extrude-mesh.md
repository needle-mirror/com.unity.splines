# Create a 3D mesh along a spline

Use the [Spline Extrude](extrude-component.md) component to extrude a mesh along a spline to create shapes such as tubes, wires, ropes, and noodles.  

To create a 3D mesh along a spline:

1. [Create a spline](create-a-spline.md).
1. Add the **Spline Extrude** component to the spline GameObject. This component controls the properties of the extruded mesh. To customize the properties, refer to the [Spline Extrude component reference](extrude-component.md).
1. Adding a **Spline Extrude** component automatically adds a **Mesh Filter** and **Mesh Renderer** component to the GameObject. These components are necessary for all 3D GameObjects. Refer to [Mesh Renderer Component](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html) and [Mesh Filter Component](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshFilter.html) for more information.
