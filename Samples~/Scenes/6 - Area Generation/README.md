# Area Generation Sample

This sample shows how object generation within a Spline's bounds can be implemented and how custom `SplineDataHandles` can be used to enable `SplineData` manipulation within Scene View. 
Select `SpawnAreaSpline01` or `SpawnAreaSpline02` game objects and manipulate their `Splines` or `SplineData` handles to see the spline-defined areas regenerate.
