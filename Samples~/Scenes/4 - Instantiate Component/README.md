# Spline Instantiate Sample

This sample demonstrates how prefabs of GameObjects can be instantiated along Splines using the `SplineInstantiate` component.
- The `Fences` object illustrates the use of the `Linear Distance` instantiation method to precisely follow the spline. 
- The `Trees` and `Grass` objects illustrate the use of `Offset` to move instances away from the spline.
- `PathSpline` is a simple illustration of a path instantiation.

- The `Environment` GameObject regroup all of these samples in a simple scene to illustrate this.
