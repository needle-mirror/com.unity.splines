# Spline Animate Component Sample

This sample demonstrates how the `SplineAnimate` component can be used in order to animate a game object's position and rotation along a Spline. Objects that are under the `NoEasing` parent move linearly and objects under the `WithEasing` parent are set up to have quadratic in and out easing. In addition, each parent's animated objects are configured to have different loop modes. Inspect objects named "AnimateObject" for more details and examples on how to configure the `SplineAnimate` component. Note: the component's "Preview" panel can be used to animate an object in Edit Mode.

Press "Play" to see the sample's game objects animate in Play Mode.
